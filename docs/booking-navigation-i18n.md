# BookingNavigation Internationalization Steps

## 1. Add Navigation Translations to data.json ✅
- Add a new section in data.json for booking navigation texts
- Include translations for:
  - "Previous"
  - "Next"
  - "Book Now"
  - "Complete Your Booking"
  - "Your total amount:"

## 2. Create Language Context Hook ✅
- Using existing useLanguage hook
- Using existing useTranslations hook for accessing translations

## 3. Update BookingNavigation Component ✅
- Imported language context and translations hook
- Replaced hardcoded strings with translations
- Updated text content dynamically based on selected language

## 4. Test Language Switching ✅
- Component will automatically respond to language changes through the useTranslations hook
- Text will update when language is switched through the site's language selector

## 5. Update Types (if necessary) ✅
- No additional types needed as we're using the existing translation system

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Add Navigation Translations
Add the following structure to data.json:

```json
{
  "en": {
    "booking": {
      "navigation": {
        "previous": "Previous",
        "next": "Next",
        "bookNow": "Book Now",
        "completeBooking": "Complete Your Booking",
        "totalAmount": "Your total amount:"
      }
    }
  },
  "es": {
    "booking": {
      "navigation": {
        "previous": "Anterior",
        "next": "Siguiente",
        "bookNow": "Reservar Ahora",
        "completeBooking": "Completar tu Reserva",
        "totalAmount": "Importe total:"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Completed Implementation ✅
- Added navigation translations to data.json
- Updated BookingNavigation component to use translations
- Integrated with existing language system
- No additional types or context needed as we're using the existing infrastructure

The implementation is now complete and the BookingNavigation component is fully internationalized! The component will automatically display text in English or Spanish based on the selected language.
